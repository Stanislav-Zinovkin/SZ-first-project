# SZ-first-project

Just like the Busby babes and days gone by
We'll keep the red flags flying high
You're gonna see us all from far and wide
You're gonna hear the Mans that sing with pride

[Refrain]
United, Man United
We're the boys in red and we're on our way to Wem-ber-ley
Wem-ber-ley, Wem-ber-ley
First project
